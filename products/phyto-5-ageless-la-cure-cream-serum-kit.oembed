The roads have faded with the spice trade, but the scents of frankincense and myrrh still float on the warm sea breezes. The 5 Secrets Serum, an integral part of the innovative Ageless Kit, is rich in anti-aging active molecules and powered by the Commiphora Mukul, an ancient family member of the myrrh tree. A rejuvenating, non-invasive, natural remedy from Ayurveda, the resin mineralizes the skin and diminish wrinkles from the inside out. Once a gift for kings and queens, the myrrh based extract increases the synthesis of lipids, toning and lifting the skin from within. Naturally rich in manganese, the resin also mineralizes and protects the skin long after use. To complement Commiphora Mukul extract, The 5 Secrets Serum contains Apricot Kernel oil, rich in healthy omega 6 \u0026amp; 9 fatty acids as well vitamins A \u0026amp; E. The oil naturally softens and hydrates the skin, and is particularly effective for dry or sensitive skin. Witch Hazel Flower Water provides soothing, anti-inflammatory, and disinfectant properties. Rose essential oil heals and purifies, soothing irritation, and redness, another great benefit for dry or sensitive skin.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe 5 Secrets Cream perfectly complements the Serum in our Ageless Kit. The cream is powered by active ingredients Aquaxyl and Easyliance, nestled among a purposeful blend of organic Cupuaçu butter, oils, vitamins, and minerals. Aquaxyl is a hydrating complex of natural extracts that has proven to be incredibly potent and effective in hydrating and restructuring cells. Easyliance, an optimized blend of synergistic ingredients, is designed specifically to tighten the skin and decrease fine lines. This cream, used alongside 5 Secrets Serum, visibly tones and lifts the skin. The 5 Secrets Cream is balanced by sustainably sourced Cupuaçu and Shea butters, designed to soften skin, moisturize, and provide a boost of omega 6 \u0026amp; 9, vitamin C, calcium, magnesium, and iron. Squalane from olive regenerates and protects the skin. Witch Hazel and Vitamin E provide a boost of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties. The combination will leave your skin healthy, vibrant and revitalized.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis thoughtful duo of serum \u0026amp; Cream, minerals \u0026amp; antioxidants, ancient \u0026amp; high-tech, targets all 5 core aspects of aging.
