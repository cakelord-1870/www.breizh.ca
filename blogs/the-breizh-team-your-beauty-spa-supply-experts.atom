      <![CDATA[<p style="float: right;">Starting in 2012 Taylor took on the position of Business Developer with (at the time) Breizh Salon Services, his family's 30 year old business. With this position it has been his responsibility to work closely with the staff to improve all aspects of the business following the recession crisis and re-stabilize and restructure a company that was not "ahead of the curve" as they say.</p>
<p style="float: left;">Since starting with the company, he has worked closely with the President, Vice-President, staff, clients and suppliers to create (better) strategies in regards to finance, marketing, operations, sales and has also been charged with creating an online, ecommerce presence, sales and building our team.</p>
<p style="float: left;">Now with his increasing involvement in the intimate pieces of the company's budgeting and strategy he became the Director of Business Development, fostering relationships with all stakeholders and sourcing new areas of business for the company.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p><strong> </strong>Coming from a business background in the late 50s Paris, Jean moved to Vancouver BC in 1964 to start out on an adventure. Already married and with child, this adventure would lead him to becoming the President of the Francophone Cultural Federation in the early and late 1970s where he was able to create the entire BC curriculum for French education. Following this he became a founding member of the BC Children’s Festival that is still happening today.</p>
During this time h<img alt="jean-riou-president-breizh-esthetics-salon-beauty-supply" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1015/3607/files/IMG_0534_medium.jpg?11486049846166971430" style="display: block; float: left; margin-left: auto; margin-right: 0.5px;">e also founded the first wholesale distributor of spa, salon and esthetics beauty supplies in Western Canada: Breizh Skincare Supply (now of course though we’re Breizh Esthetics &amp; Salon Supply).<br><br><br>
<p>He is still very much an active member of the business and  his community, never a day where he’s not up at 5am for his daily jog.</p>
